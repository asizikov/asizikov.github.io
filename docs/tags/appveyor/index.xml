      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine modern development without continuous intergation and unit-tests.
At work I hardly pay attention on the process, it just works: I push code to GitHub, later on TeamCity picks up changes and starts the build, and few minutes after I receive Slack or email notification about the result. However for my personal projects things are different. I&amp;rsquo;m using free plan on AppVeyor. It works pretty well except the fact that your build might stay in the queue for a while.</description>

      <description>This is a long title. Well, the post is going to be long as well.
I want to show how you can set up the CI pipeline using free services and tools.
 GitHub GitVersion AppVeyor  As an example I&amp;rsquo;m going to use my pet project: AsyncSuffix plugin for ReSharper. The reason is that the way you pack and publish R# extensions is slightly different from the regular NuGet package.</description>
