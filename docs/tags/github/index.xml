      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent request from a customer caught my attention. They were trying to set up a CD pipeline that should deploy packages to production when there is a new tag pushed to the repository. At the same time, they wanted some control over the process so that not everyone can init a release by pushing a tag to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using GitHub Container Registry with Kubernetes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub Container Registry was introduced on the 1st of September 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s still in the Beta stage, so it&amp;rsquo;s rather not recommended to use it in production. However, it offers us free private storage for our Docker images, at least until the end of the Beta period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s very important to collect and track as much information as you can about your system. We have logging, monitoring, reports and analytics. All the systems that we build are not just packages, which are deployed to the server/computer or device. Everything starts with Issue Tracking system and through the code goes to production. The code and the process of coding both look like an important part of the system and it makes a lot of sense to collect and store all the data about code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use different accounts and different computers to work with GitHub repositories, so sometimes I face the situation when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my SSH key generated for the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
