<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing code reviews on a daily basis for several years for now. This activity is very different from what I do as a developer.</p>
<p>Most of the time I try to understand, debug, fix or update existing code. Less often developers write new code from scratch.  I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that we all know how to work with a code written by another human.</p>
<p>One might want to say that if we know how to work with other people&rsquo;s code, we can be good at reading and understanding it during the code review process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a difference. When we work with a code we have it opened in our editor or IDE. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a modern heavy IDE or a lightweight editor. What&rsquo;s important is that this is a tool which we are familiar with.</p>
<p>We know how to get extra information about any line code on the screen. In my case, it&rsquo;s a Visual Studio with ReSharper and several more extensions. I have color coded info, I have tooltips and I can navigate through the code.</p>
<p>However, when reviewing a Pull Request on GitHub I have just a basic syntax highlighting in the editor.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/nancy-pr.png" alt="Pull Request sample"></p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Modern programming languages allow a developer to skip some symbols and take some shortcuts. It&rsquo;s different for every language, I&rsquo;ll use C# as an example in this post.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="n">ProcessSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Guid</span> <span class="n">accountId</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">AccountBalance</span> <span class="n">accountBalance</span> <span class="p">=</span> 
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">balanceCalculator</span>
        <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetAccountBalanceAsAtDate</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">Guid</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="n">accountId</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">accountId</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">DateUtils</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Yesterday</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CalculateFees</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">accountBalance</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here we have a short method implementation. C# keywords are in blue-ish color, method names are in magenta, the rest is gray.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t know C# you can read and understand what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>If you do know C# you&rsquo;d notice that this code is rather redundant. However, this is pretty much how compiler sees your code. Ok, almost :)</p>
<p>Let me read this code. I&rsquo;ll try to read all the information which I see here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This method takes an account id (GUID). First it calls the <strong>GetAccountBalanceAsAtDate</strong> generic method with <strong>Guid</strong> generic parameter. This method is an instance method of field <strong>balanceCalculator</strong>.
This is a current class instance field.<br>
There are two parameters passed to that method. The first one is an account id, the parameter name is <strong>accountId</strong>. The second parameter name is <strong>date</strong>, and we pass the value of the property called <strong>Yesterday</strong> of the current class instance property called <strong>DateUtils</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is assigned to the local variable <strong>accountBalance</strong> of <strong>AccountBalance</strong> type.
After that the result is passed to the instance method <strong>CalculateFees</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of information, right? We know types, parameter names, we know that methods and properties are not static and so on.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t know what type <code>Yesterday</code> is, but the rest is clear. We have plenty of information about the logic of the method as well as about types and even some details about <code>GetAccountBalanceAsAtDate</code> method signature.</p>
<h2 id="getting-simpler">Getting simpler</h2>
<p>When I look at this code in my IDE I see that some code is marked as redundant (grayed out):</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/redundant-code.png" alt="Same Code in IDE"></p>
<p>What if I apply suggested &ldquo;Remove redundant code&rdquo; refactorings? We&rsquo;d loose some information about this method. I&rsquo;m going to be careful here.</p>
<h3 id="argument-names">Argument names</h3>
<p>Explicit argument names here are probably the least important information. Even more, it&rsquo;s a bit misleading. Are the arguments optional or not? We don&rsquo;t know that. (Well, I do know, and they are not optional).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remove them:</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/redundant-code-no-args-names.png" alt="Code in IDE, argument names omitted"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to repeat our exercise one more time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This method takes an account id (GUID). First it calls the <strong>GetAccountBalanceAsAtDate</strong> generic method with <strong>Guid</strong> generic parameter. This method is an instance method of field <strong>balanceCalculator</strong>.
This is a current class instance field.<br>
There are two parameters passed to that method. The first one is an account id, and as a second parameter  we pass the value of the property called <strong>Yesterday</strong> of the current class instance property called <strong>DateUtils</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is assigned to the local variable <strong>accountBalance</strong> of <strong>AccountBalance</strong> type.
After that the result is passed to the instance method <strong>CalculateFees</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hm, looks like we didn&rsquo;t lose much information, right?</p>
<h3 id="explicit-variable-type">Explicit variable type</h3>
<p>When reviewing this snippet we don&rsquo;t know much about <code>AccountBalance</code> type. Is it a <code>struct</code> or a <code>class</code>? What kind of data does it contain?</p>
<p>In fact, we can just omit the type declaration here.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/redundant-code-use-var.png" alt="Code in IDE, use var instead of Explicit type"></p>
<p>So far so good. We don&rsquo;t know the type, but we do know that the type is correct. We were able to pass it to <code>CalculateFees</code> method, and our code compiles.</p>
<h3 id="generic-parameter-type">Generic parameter type</h3>
<p>What kind of information could the reviewer gather from the explicit generic parameter type specification?</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps we can figure out that the method <strong>is</strong> generic. Well, good to know, but as long as the compiler can build the code, it doesn&rsquo;t matter for the reviewer.</p>
<p>After all the reviewer is not trying to catch compilation errors, eh?</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/redundant-code-no-generic-type.png" alt="Code in IDE, implicit generic parameter type"></p>
<h3 id="this-qualifier">this qualifier</h3>
<p>This is a very painful moment.</p>
<p>There is a StyleCope rule <a href="http://stylecop.soyuz5.com/SA1101.html">SA1101: PrefixLocalCallsWithThis</a> which originally <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis/2008/05/25/a-brief-history-of-c-style/">aimed against underscore prefixes</a> for instance variables.</p>
<p>First of, all we should understand, that the compiler does know that <code>CalculateFees()</code> is an instance method of the current class. It does know where <code>DateUtils</code> comes from.</p>
<p>Honestly, how often do you need to know if <code>balanceCalculator</code> is an instance variable? That might be important when you editing the code. Not very often, but I can buy this argument.</p>
<p>But is that important during the code review? I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s not. Id doesn&rsquo;t matter for this method. The method is short enough so we can see that <code>balanceCalculator</code> is not declared inside the method.
If the method was longer, it would not be important anyway. What&rsquo;s important is that the <code>balanceCalculator</code> was used to calculate the balance.</p>
<p>Nobody would argue that the code outside of the editor contains less information about its structure. The absence of this knowledge is not that bad, though.</p>
<p>For example, When reviewing the code outside of the editor no one can tell what&rsquo;s going on here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Bar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Car</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Barr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Car</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Barrr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Car</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Each <code>*.Car</code> could be either a property of current class instance property or a static property of another class or an enum value. <code>this.</code> qualifier will help us with the first option, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>In your IDE you&rsquo;ll spend a second to find out, right? I&rsquo;ll use color codes:</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/color-codes.png" alt="Code in IDE, no redundant code"></p>
<p>You can hover or navigate to it. Doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>When you read this code as a plain text you can only tell that the method <code>Foo</code> is doing something with the car. You have lost some information, and you only have a semantics of the code here.</p>
<p>And this is just fine. You can focus on what the code does, not on how it does. The &ldquo;how&rdquo; part is checked by the compiler.</p>
<p>It requires some courage, but I&rsquo;m going to remove all <code>this.</code> prefixes.</p>
<h2 id="final-look">Final look</h2>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/no-redundant.png" alt="Code in IDE, no redundant code"></p>
<p>So, what do we have here? As we learned, as a reviewer we need to focus on the logic, and we shouldn&rsquo;t try to chase any errors which can be caught by the compiler.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s read it one more time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The method takes and account Id as an argument, calls <strong>GetAccountBalanceAsAtDate</strong> method of the <strong>balanceCalculator</strong>. <strong>accounId</strong> is passed as a first parameter, the second parameter is a value <strong>Yesterday</strong> of <strong>DateUtils</strong>.
The result of that method call is used as a parameter for  <strong>CalculateFees</strong> method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now scroll up and compare with the first attempt. Much shorter, right?</p>
<p>Ok, the reviewer has no information about types, about the nature of methods and properties. They do not know what <code>DayUtils</code> is. It might be an <code>enum</code>, or a static class or anything else.</p>
<p>The only information that reviewer has is the logic of the method. And now they can focus on it because that&rsquo;s what is important here after all. The logic, not the AST structure.</p>
<p><img src="/images/code-for-reviewer/review.png" alt="Review "></p>
<p>Please, let the compiler to its job, and help the reviewer focus on what <strong>does</strong> matter here.</p>
<p>Feel free to comment on this if you agree or disagree.</p>
