  </p>

  <p>Throughout 2025, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with various ways to organize my development workflow with coding agents, trying to maximize the joy of building a product while minimizing the human effort required to get things done.</p>
<p>Aside from the day-to-day work I do as a Solutions Engineer at GitHub, I&rsquo;ve been building multiple projects that are either being used internally at GitHub, shared with our customers, or just personal apps that I build for myself. This gave me a great opportunity to try out different ways of working with coding agents (I primarily use GitHub Copilot, but as a learning experience I use others too) to see what works best for me.</p>
<p>Looking at my contributions graph for the past year, you can clearly see when agents unlocked me to ship more:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2026-01-workflow/00-year-gh.png" alt="GitHub contributions graph"></p>
<p>While I have been working as a developer professionally for over a decade and have been coding since I was a kid, I now have (almost) completely stopped writing code manually.</p>
<p>With the breakthroughs in AI-assisted coding, I have changed and adjusted my workflow many times, testing out some approaches that worked well and some that didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll describe my current approach as of January 2026.</p>
<h2 id="my-toolset">My Toolset</h2>
<p>Naturally, my work is primarily built around GitHub Copilot, but most of these principles can be applied to other coding agents as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IDE</strong>: I use Visual Studio Code Insiders as my primary IDE and JetBrains Rider for more advanced .NET work (I just like the debugging and profiling experience better there).</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong>: Terminal based experience. Below, I&rsquo;ll explain how I choose between IDE and CLI.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Repositories and Issues</strong>: That&rsquo;s where my code lives, that&rsquo;s where I track my work.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot Coding Agent</strong>: Asynchronous coding agent, responsible for tasks that do not require interactive user input.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Code Review Agent</strong>: Automatic code reviews.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Advanced Security &amp; CodeQuality</strong>: Security and code quality analysis.</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT Projects</strong>: Some projects live in ChatGPT, where I use Projects to keep track of project context and decisions. I don&rsquo;t do it for every project, but a couple live there. I&rsquo;ll explain why.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Mobile</strong>: Yup, I sometimes use mobile app to run Coding Agent tasks while on the go.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vibe-coding-ish">Vibe-coding-ish</h2>
<p>This term has its fans and haters. However, I&rsquo;m at a place where I write almost no code manually.</p>
<p>Looking at the past 28-day telemetry:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2026-01-workflow/01-statistics.png" alt="Statistics"></p>
<p>We can see that in this period, using Agent Mode I added 11k lines of code and deleted 1.4k loc with the net total of 9.5k lines of code contributed to the projects I work on. While the Completions show only 385 lines of code added. Those are mostly configs, comments, docs and small tweaks that do not deserve an agentic session. Oh, and I don&rsquo;t use Chat mode at all. Chat requires manual context management, while Agent Mode is more autonomous, I can just ask a question and let it find the relevant information online or in the repo itself.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The telemetry does not include any code contributed outside of my IDEs (CLI and Copilot Coding Agent sessions are not tracked here).
More about this dashboard <a href="/2025/12/09/copilot-metrics/">in one of my previous posts</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, I do not &ldquo;vibe-code&rdquo; as in the original sense of the term. I look at the code, I care about quality, I refactor, fully control what goes in and what does not. But the way I do it is different from what I used to do in the past.</p>
<h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>
<p>What has shifted the most for me is the way I approach codebase state. I define the architecture, the structure, components inside my app and then I let the agents do their thing. Naturally, the architecture shifts a little, abstractions that were created initially may not be working well. In a sense, I can say that I do not overplan as I used to in the past, because in the traditional engineering complex refactorings are expensive. That&rsquo;s not really the case with coding agents, the code is cheap, my time is more valuable.</p>
<p>That means that the life of my codebase is more dynamic. We start with the initial structure, we build features, and then, when I notice that it&rsquo;s time, I launch the architecture feedback session, plan the refactoring interactively with Copilot, and once the plan is finalized, I let the agent execute it. This process used to be fragile in the beginning of 2025, but now it&rsquo;s quite reliable.</p>
<p>Another signal for me to refactor is&hellip; AI-powered: Copilot Code Quality analysis does provide good feedback on the code health, and when I see that the score is dropping, it&rsquo;s time to do some refactoring.</p>
<p>So, it is a loop now:</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize architecture</strong> -&gt; <strong>Build features</strong> -&gt; <strong>Analyze code quality</strong> -&gt; <strong>Refactor</strong> -&gt; <strong>Repeat</strong>.</p>
<p>While it felt a little uncomfortable in the beginning, I find it to be a nice balance between control, speed of development, and flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="when-i-choose-cli-vs-ide-vs-coding-agent">When I choose CLI vs IDE vs Coding Agent</h2>
<p>I spoke about it in <a href="/2025/12/22/copilot-customization/">Copilot Customization</a> blog post, but to summarize:</p>
<p>Whenever I have a task in mind, I already &ldquo;feel&rdquo; if this is a task that requires an interactive approach, can be fully delegated to an agent, and if it requires me having a full &ldquo;picture&rdquo; in front of me.</p>
<p>Well-scoped tasks that I know the agent can handle on its own, I delegate to Copilot Coding Agent (in the cloud) or run locally as Background agent (it&rsquo;ll create a new git worktree and run on my machine without interfering with my IDE session).</p>
<p>Tasks that I know will take some time to complete, but do not require me to be fully engaged, I run in CLI mode.</p>
<p>These will be (not exhaustive list):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Scaffolding</strong>: When I can provide a clear prompt and the agent will take time.</li>
<li><strong>Large Refactorings</strong>: When I have a clear plan and the agent can execute it.</li>
<li><strong>Non-coding tasks</strong>: Docs, codebase analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Features in the familiar codebase</strong>: If I keep the project in my head fully, and I have the implementation plan ready, I can just point CLI to the files that need to be updated and describe a feature to be added.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/2026-01-workflow/02-agent-session.png" alt="CLI session example"></p>
<p>Finally, tasks that require me to be fully hands-on, I do in IDE.</p>
<p>These would often be tasks that I don&rsquo;t know how to solve upfront. I will chat with the agent, run planning mode, ask it for suggestions, iterate on the design. I would need to explore the codebase (done easier in IDE, the muscle memory helps here).</p>
<p>Tasks that would require some research upfront: fetching docs from external sources, asking Copilot to run CLI tools to do something with the infrastructure. In this case, I find it easier to control what the agent is doing. I can stop, interrupt, update the tool call.</p>
<p>Another category is when I need to do a lot of UI polishing work. Being able to attach screenshots via VS Code Simple Browser tool is priceless here.</p>
<p>What I noticed though, is that over time, as I get more comfortable with the CLI tools (or they getting better?), I tend to move more and more tasks to them.</p>
<h2 id="copilot-code-review-agent-and-code-quality">Copilot Code Review Agent and Code Quality</h2>
<p>Most of the projects I work on I act as a solo developer. Which means I&rsquo;m the one responsible for building the code and making sure it&rsquo;s of high-enogh quality.
That being said, I do use tools available at my disposal to make sure the code is solid.</p>
<p>This part changed a lot, compared to how I&rsquo;ve been bilding personal projects in the past. I now produce more code than I used to, and review stage becomes a bottleneck.
Yes, I still need to check what I&rsquo;m about to merge in, but an extra pair of eyes is a mast.</p>
<p>Every PR goes through Copilot Code Review Agent, the feedback it provides is getting better and better over time. It used to focus on the simple things in the past, looking only at the PR commit diff, but now it can analyze the full context of the codebase, understand architecture. Which picks up code duplications, violation of design principles, and such. More often than not, I click &ldquo;Apply suggestions&rdquo; and let the agent fix the issues it found.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I use GitHub Advanced Security &amp; CodeQuality analysis to catch issues in the codebase in a more deterministic way. Both tools are based on CodeQL, just focus on different aspects of code health.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-go">On the go</h2>
<p>Another tool that I&rsquo;ve never thought I&rsquo;d use for coding is GitHub Mobile app. I mean, sure, I used it to check notifications, comment on PRs, but the experience is suboptimal. Surely, doing that in the browser is easier.</p>
<p>And suddenly, I have an option to pick up the idea when I&rsquo;m away from my computer (tell me I&rsquo;m not the only one who gets &ldquo;wait a minute, that sounds like a good feature&rdquo; thoughts just before falling asleep) and assign Coding Agent to implement it. I&rsquo;ll check the results next day, there is no rush.</p>
<h2 id="what-didnt-work-for-me">What didn&rsquo;t work for me</h2>
<p>Well, this is an extremely dynamic space, there are many bright ideas out there, and I did try quite a few of them. Some just didn&rsquo;t stick, some worked for a while and then I moved on.</p>
<h3 id="spec-driven-development">Spec-Driven Development.</h3>
<p>Somewhere in the era of GPT-4.1 and Sonnet 3.5 agents were&hellip; well, not quite good at their job. They required a lot of steering, manual context management, they needed detailed specs to work from.</p>
<p>The spec-driven approach felt like a good solution. I did try a few tools for that, including a pretty hardcore <code>speckit</code> and a number of more lightweight solutions. They do the job, but I never liked the overhead they bring. Nowadays, with custom planning agents and much more capable models it&rsquo;s just not necessary anymore. So I dropped them completely.</p>
<h3 id="agents-orchestration-tools">Agents orchestration tools.</h3>
<p>This seems to be a hot topic these days (I get it, it looks awesome, when you can kick of 5-8 agentic sessions in the terminal and watch them cook). But these workflows require a lot of focus to be working effectively. I just don&rsquo;t have that much time, so I passed on that for now. Let&rsquo;s see if it changes this year.</p>
