  <p>title: &ldquo;My GitHub Copilot-Powered Development Workflow&rdquo;
date: 2026-01-07
slug: &ldquo;my-github-copilot-powered-development-workflow&rdquo;
tags: [&ldquo;github copilot&rdquo;, &ldquo;developer-tools&rdquo;]
draft: false</p>
<p>Throughout 2025, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with various ways to organize my development workflow with coding agents, trying to maximize the joy of building a product while minimizing the human effort required to get things done.</p>
<p>Aside from the day-to-day work I do as a Solutions Engineer at GitHub, I&rsquo;ve been building multiple projects that are either being used internally at GitHub, shared with our customers, or just personal projects that I build for myself. This gave me a great opportunity to try out different ways of working with coding agents (I primarily use GitHub Copilot, but as a learning experience I use others too) to see what works best for me.</p>
<p>While I have been working as a developer for over a decade and have been coding since I was a kid, I now have completely stopped writing code manually.</p>
<p>With the breakthroughs in AI-assisted coding, I have changed my workflow many times, testing out some approaches that worked well and some that didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll describe my current approach as of January 2026.</p>
<h2 id="my-toolset">My Toolset</h2>
<p>Naturally, my work is primarily built around GitHub Copilot, but most of these principles can be applied to other coding agents as well.</p>
<h2 id="vibe-coding-ish">Vibe-coding-ish</h2>
<p>This term has its fans and haters. However, I&rsquo;m at a place where I write almost no code manually.</p>
<p>Looking at the past 28-day telemetry:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2026-01-workflow/01-statistics.png" alt="Statistics"></p>
<p>We can see that in this period, using Agent Mode I added 11k lines of code and deleted 1.4k loc with the net total of 9.5k lines of code contributed to the projects I work on. While the Completions show only 385 lines of code added. Those are mostly configs, comments, docs and small tweaks that do not deserve an agentic session. Oh, and I don&rsquo;t use Chat mode at all. Chat requires manual context management, while Agent Mode is more autonomous, I can just ask a question and let it find the relevant information online or in the repo itself.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The telemetry does not include any code contributed outside of my IDEs (CLI and Copilot Coding Agent sessions are not tracked here).
More about this dashboard <a href="/2025/12/09/copilot-metrics/">in one of my previous posts</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, I do not &ldquo;vibe-code&rdquo; as in the original sense of the term. I look at the code, I care about quality, I refactor, fully control what goes in and what does not. But the way I do it is different from what I used to do in the past.</p>
<h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>
<p>What has shifted the most for me is the way I approach codebase state. I define the architecture, the structure, components inside my app and then I let the agents do their thing. Naturally, the architecture shifts a little, abstractions that were created initially may not be working well. In a sense, I can say that I do not overplan as I used to in the past, because in the traditional engineering complex refactorings are expensive. That&rsquo;s not really the case with coding agents, the code is cheap, my time is more valuable.</p>
<p>That means that the life of my codebase is more dynamic. We start with the initial structure, we build features and then, when I notice that it&rsquo;s time, I launch the architecture feedback session, plan the refactoring interactively with Copilot and once the plan is finalized, I let the agent execute it. That used to be fragile in the beginning of 2025, but now it&rsquo;s quite reliable.</p>
<p>Another signal for me to refactor is&hellip; AI-powered: Copilot Code Quality analysis does provide good feedback on the code health, and when I see that the score is dropping, it&rsquo;s time to do some refactoring.</p>
<p>So, it is a loop now:</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize architecture</strong> -&gt; <strong>Build features</strong> -&gt; <strong>Analyze code quality</strong> -&gt; <strong>Refactor</strong> -&gt; <strong>Repeat</strong>.</p>

<p>My tech stack varies based on the project, but I mostly work with .NET, TypeScript/JavaScript.</p>
