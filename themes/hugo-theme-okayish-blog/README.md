## Getting Started

> I assume that you already have a Hugo site project. If not, you can create one
> by following [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

To use the theme, add it to your site's theme directory:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/kongdivin/hugo-theme-okayish-blog.git themes/hugo-theme-okayish-blog
```

Then tell Hugo to use `hugo-theme-okayish-blog` by adding/updating the following
in `config.toml`

```toml
# File: config.toml

theme = "hugo-theme-okayish-blog"
```

### Cloning an existing repository

If you have an existing repository that was setup with the steps above, you have
to pull in the theme submodule after cloning your repository using the following
command:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

# so that you can provide metadata for each author
#
# See: https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#add-custom-metadata-to-a-taxonomy-term
author = "authors"

# Add menu items to the navigation bar as below.
# N.B. Use identifiers as the keys for translations.
[menu]

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "authors"
name = "Authors"
url = "/authors"

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "categories"
name = "Categories"
url = "/categories"

# For i18n support, add the language codes here
# and provide translations in `i18n` folder. E.g., `i18n/en-US.toml`
[languages]

[languages.en-us]
languageName = "English (US)"

[languages.km-kh]
languageName = "ភាសាខ្មែរ"
```

These configurations are the main ones. For more, please check [Configure
Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/).

### Custom Home Page

The default homepage is showing the list of pages in the main sections. In case
you want a custom homepage, you can create `layouts/index.html`. For example,

```html
<!-- File: layouts/index.html -->

{{ define "main"}}
<h1>My New Home Page</h1>
{{ end }}
```

Since the theme is using Vanilla. You can use all its available components. See
its [docs](https://docs.vanillaframework.io/) for more details. Need
inspirations? There you go, https://vanillaframework.io/showcase.

### Custom Style

To provide a custom stylesheet, create `layouts/partials/head-extension.html` in
your site directory to override the one the theme's created. Then put the link
to your stylesheet in that file. For example,

```html
<!-- File: layouts/partials/head-extension.html -->

<link href={{ "css/custom.css" | relURL }} rel="stylesheet"><link />
```
