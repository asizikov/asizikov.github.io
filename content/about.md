I'm an Amsterdam-based software engineer, building cool things on the .NET platform and Azure.

I wrote my first line of code in Pascal when I was 15. Or 14? In 2003, I got my first copy of Visual Studio .NET and a book about C++. Well, you know it's hard to build a C++ Hello World program with C# compiler. It took me a while to realize that I'm using the wrong language. Anyway, for now, C# is the main and most powerful tool in my toolset.

Since that time I've been working with various technologies: mobile, desktop, web (backend and frontend).

## What am I up to these days?

I currently work as an Enterprise Solutions Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com) and as an independent consultant at [Arcticfox Consulting](https://arcticfox-consulting.com/).

I know a thing or two about GitHub, CI/CD, SDLC, Cloud and programming.
