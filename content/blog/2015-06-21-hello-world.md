I'm not sure if I can be more hipster, but now I have a blog which is hosted by GitHub pages and served by jekyll.
Yeah, I had to install python and ruby to run it.



{{< highlight csharp >}}
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
