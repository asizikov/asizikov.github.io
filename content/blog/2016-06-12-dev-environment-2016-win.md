I've changed a job last month and had to build up my dev environment from scratch again. While doing that I decided to write down some thoughts about it. 

I guess it might be interesting to look back at some point and see how does it evolve.

## Background

At my previous employer, we were very into Virtual Machines. We had different base VMs which every developer can download. 

That's extremely handy when a new hire has nothing to do, but to install just a couple of tools that are not standard, and enter some credentials.

You remember those dialogs: 

>--- I can't build the project. Packages are missing...
>
--- Oh, yep, you need to add this private NuGet feed.
>
>...
>
>--- I can't run the project locally. 
>
>--- Yeah, I think you need so put these lines into your `hosts` file.

Well, now it's all gone.

It's not only limited to this scenario. You want to experiment with a new unstable version of the framework (yes, [.NET Core RC-final-almost-stable](https://twitter.com/NETCoreReadyYet/status/735972346436161536), I'm talking about you) and you don't want to mess up with your dev machine?

Just fire a new VM up. 

Got a neat idea for a hackathon, but you think that JDK is not what you need on your computer? Giving a tech demo on the local meetup?  

A VM comes to the rescue.

Got a new computer? Just copy the VM over and you're up to speed in 20 minutes.

## Back to the topic

So, what do I have on my base VM? 

### Frameworks

I'm a .NET web developer, so nothing special here:

* .NET framework 4.5.2 and 4.6

### File Managers and command line shell

* [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) A cross-platform UI tool for Git.

GitKraken is quite heavy and not super fast as most of the electron.js based tools are, but I find it's history tree view very readable. The merge tool is not bad at all. 
 
I do most of the git related operations in git bash, though.

## Debugging and profiling

* IIS and SQL Express 

### Web tools and services

Besides all the tools above which I have installed locally there are web services I use on a pretty much daily basis.

* [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/). An easy to use HTTP request inspector.
* [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/). A free CI/CD service for my open source projects.
* [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/). A super awesome regular expressions builder and debugger.
* [Toggl](https://toggl.com). A time tracker.


## Batch install

Most of the tools could be installed from Chocolatey [gallery](https://chocolatey.org/packages).

```bash
choco install dotnet4.5.2 linqpad -y
```

I prefer to have all the tools grouped into `.config` files: 

```xml
<!-- commandline-tools.config -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
  <package id="git" />
  <package id="far" />
  <package id="nuget.commandline" />
  <package id="conemu" />
</packages>
```

and they could be installed all together.

## A call to action

Are there any tools around which are worth to try? 

Please share in comments. I'm always keen on trying new things.
