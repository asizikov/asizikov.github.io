I'm not sure if I can be more hipster, but now I have a blog whichs hosted by GitHub pages and served by jekyll.
Yeah, I had to install python and ruby to run it.



{% highlight csharp %}
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
