I'm an Amsterdam-based software engineer, building cool things on the .NET platform and Azure.

I wrote my first line of code in Pascal when I was 15. Or 14? In 2003, I got my first copy of Visual Studio .NET and a book about C++. Well, you know it's hard to build a C++ Hello World program with C# compiler. It took me a while to realize that I'm using the wrong language. Anyway, for now, C# is the main and most powerful tool in my toolset.

Since that time I've been working with various technologies: mobile, desktop, web (backend and frontend). 

## What am I up to these days?

I currently work as a Cloud Engineering Lead at Xccelerated. 

In this role am responsible for hiring, training, and mentoring a group of young career-switchers in their journey towards the cloud engineer role. This includes building training materials, giving lectures, weekly mentoring sessions, design reviews, and consulting. However, I still keep my hands dirty and work as an external Cloud Solutions Architect.
